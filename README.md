## Usage

The Ngau Calculator helps you determine the best possible hand in the card game Ngau. Ngau involves making combinations of cards to achieve the highest possible score. The calculator takes five cards as input and outputs the best combination of "bull" (a group of three cards that sum to a multiple of 10) and the remaining two cards.

### How to Use

1.  Enter five cards into the calculator. You can use numbers (2-10), or J, Q, K, A (Ace of Spades).
2.  The calculator will determine the best "bull" group and the remaining cards.
3.  The result will show the type of hand (e.g., Ngau Tongku, Pair, Normal) and the points.

## Architecture

The project is structured as follows:

-   `src/app/page.tsx`: Main page component, responsible for rendering the calculator UI.
-   `src/components/NgauCalculator.tsx`: The main calculator component, handling user input and displaying the results.
-   `src/lib/calculator.ts`: Contains the core logic for calculating the best Ngau combination.
-   `src/components/ui/`: Reusable UI components built with Shadcn UI.

For technical users:

The `src/lib/calculator.ts` file implements the following algorithm:

1.  **Combination Generation:** It generates all possible combinations of three cards from the hand of five cards using a recursive generator function.
2.  **Bull Validation:** For each combination, it checks if the sum of the three cards is a multiple of 10 (a valid "bull"). This involves mapping each card to its possible numerical values (e.g., 'A' to 1, 'J', 'Q', 'K' to 10).
3.  **Score Calculation:** If a valid "bull" is found, it calculates the score of the remaining two cards based on their combination (Ngau, Double, or Normal).
4.  **Best Hand Determination:** The calculator then determines the best combination based on a ranking system (Ngau > Double > Normal) and the points associated with each hand.
